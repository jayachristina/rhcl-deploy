= Setup Prerequisites

* Before diving into the **Platform engineer and developer** lab workflow, as an **infrastructure owner** you first need to install and deploy Kuadrant on a single-node Red Hat OpenShift cluster to set up the necessary environment for the upcoming tasks.

* There are 3 primary prerequisites for setting up Connectivity Link:
. Create Managed Zone on DNS Provider
. Install and configure **cert-manager** operator
. Setup Gateway API v1 CRS

== Objectives

In this chapter, you will:

* Configure managed zone that will serve as the foundation for routing and managing your API traffic.
* Install cert-manager to manage TLS certificates for your Kuadrant gateways.
* Setup Istio as a Gateway API provider by installing and configuring Istio using the Service Mesh.
* Install the Connectivity Link Operator and trigger the deployment of Connectivity Link (Kuadrant) in single node Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

== Prerequisites

In order to complete the upcoming sections in this lab, ensure you perform the following steps to gain the necessary access:

* Verify **oc** client installation.
** Confirm whether the **oc** client is installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes",bash]
----
**oc version**
----
====

** If the **oc** client is not installed, refer to the https://docs.okd.io/4.10/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[official documentation] for installation instructions.

** Once installed, re-run the oc version command to confirm the installation was successful.

* **Log into to _Red Hat OpenShift cluster_** as the __kubeadmin__ user and password provided in the lab environment page and follow below steps:
** Locate the **kube-admin** dropdown at the top right corner and select **Copy login command** as shown in the image:

** Return to your bastion server terminal and paste the copied token to log in to your _Red Hat OpenShift cluster_.

* Now, you're logged into the Red Hat OpenShift cluster with admin privileges and ready to proceed with the lab.
